# Project - CSCE 156

FarMarT project

This is the project for class CSCE 156 - SEC 150

## Phase 1:
Notes:
 - Understand the object class
 - Following the enscapsulation, and single-responsibility principle

Requirement:
 - Making test case/ creating CSV files
 - Parsing the data from CSV files
 - Output the data as JSON or XML files

Approaching:
 - Creating classes: Person, Address, Store, Item, Equipment, Product, and Service 
 - Input the data from CSV files, and instantiating the classes (Hint: Using HashMap, or List)
 - Output the data from three classes as the JSON, or XML files
 - Making JUnit Test (Optional)

## Phase 2:
Notes:
 - Following 4 principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
 - Understand the abstract class
 - Understand the comparator, and sorting method (For bonus)
  
Requirement:
 - Making test case/ creating CSV files
 - Creating the class to model the system and funcutionality as specified and hold appropriate data
 - Loading the data, and create 3 reports:
   + The first report will give a summary of all sales along with a few totals
   + The second report will give a similiar summary but for each store
   + The final report will give details for each individual invoice  
 - Formating the reports

Approaching:
 - Creating classes: Invoice, and InvoiceItem
 - Mapping the "idCode" for each variable in Invoice, and InvoiceItem
 - Creating the method to calculate the items price
 - Making and formating the reports collecting data from .txt file
 - Making Junit Test (Optional)

## Phase 3:
Notes:
 - Get used with the database
 - Learning to create table, and some basic queries in MySQL
 - Learning to use foreign keys, primary keys, and table relationships
  
Requirement:
 - Creating table containing all necessary classes from phase 2
 - Creating queries supporting, and checking the database
 - Creating FMT Diagram

Approaching:
 - Creating table: Person, Email, Address, State, Country, Store, Invoice, InvoiceItem, and Item
 - Creating primary keys, and necessary forigned keys depend on relationships among the tables
 - Creating queries to check the performance of data following the project's requirement
 - Mapping the FMT diagram

## Phase 4:
  
Requirement:
 - Learning Database connection by updating data in Programming Java, and transfer these data to Database in MySQL

Approaching:
 - Create a helper class to connect database to Programming Java.

## Phase 5:

Requirement:
 - Learning Database connection by updating data in Database, and transfer these data to Programming Java
 - Printing out a new financial reports collecting data from Database.

Approaching:
 - Create a helper class to connect database to Programming Java.
 - Create a helper class that is able to use the queries syntax in MySQL.

## Phase 5:

Note:
 - Adapting the Sorted Linked List algorithm for the project.

Requirement:
 - Creating Sorted Linked List to arrange the data after connecting to the database.
 - Printing out a report using the new sorted linked lists.
